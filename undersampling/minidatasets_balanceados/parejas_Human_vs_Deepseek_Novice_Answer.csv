        1. can I generate all substrings and check if the strings in the 
        dictionary are present in the substring.
        2. This will not work, why? Because strings in the mother set 
        may have been used already to create another string
        
        SOLUTION
        --------------------------
        1. Go through the dictionary of words and find the string which is the 
        potential begining of the string
        2. segment the length of that string from the string.
        3. Check if the remaining string can also be segmented in words from 
        the dictionary.
        4. if there are no more strings to segment then we can return True.
        5. This is a recurrence problem and can be solved with the recurrence 
        solution.
        
        6. The recurrence function should go through the word dictionary 
        and the one which qualifies will now segment the rest of the string 
        and check for the rest of the segment of the string.
        
        FOR THE RECURRENCE RELATION
        
        1. With every word in the dictionary, get the length of the word.
        2. Check if a segment of the string is equal to that word.
        3. if True, call the function of the rest of the segment of the string.
        
        Base Case:
        1. If all strings are segmented, which means we have the empty ("""") string
        so we can then return True
        
        2. Else we return False
